# What is ORM?

**Stand for `Object Relational Mapper`.**

It's a `programming technique`/`technology` that acts as a bridge between our object-oriented code and relational databases.

**ORM in EF plays a crucial role in simplifying data access and development for web applications.**

- It allows you to `focus` on your application logic and business rules instead of worrying about the underlying database details.

# How does it works

## Relational Databases:

**Store data in tables with rows and columns.**

**Use SQL commands to interact with the data.**

## Object-Oriented Programming:

**Represents data as objects with properties and methods.**
**Easier to understand and work with compared to raw SQL.**

## The Problem:

**These two worlds are incompatible.**
**Manually translating between objects and SQL can be time-consuming and error-prone.**

## The Solution: ORM (EF in this case)

**Provides an abstraction layer that simplifies data access.**

**Maps your object-oriented classes to database tables.**

- Translates your object operations into SQL queries behind the scenes.

# Ways to interact with Database

## Traditional way:

- We write SQL queries to interact with our database.

- This requires deep knowledge of SQL syntax and the specific schema of our database.

- Changes to our data model often require modifying both our code and database schema.

## With ORM (like EF):

- We define our data model using classes and objects in our C# code.
- The ORM **_automatically maps these objects to tables and columns_** in our database.
- We interact with our data using our objects, writing code that's more natural and closer to our application logic.
- Changes to our data model can often be reflected in our C# code and **automatically handled** by the ORM.
